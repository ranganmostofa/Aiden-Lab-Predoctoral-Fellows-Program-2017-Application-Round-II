Built an encryptor that accepts a 10-20 digit number as input and produces a cipher (containing letters and numbers) that can be decrypted back into the original number. The encryptor uses the Markov Chain Metropolis Algorithm and a predefined novel (such as War and Peace) to encrypt the input number. A decryptor was also built on the same basis.
